                    Uncle Sheldon has always been something of a renaissance man. The work he has done in this area is only one aspect of his tireless curiosity and zest for life. He ran cross country in high school, and almost lettered his sophomore year. A lifelong student, Sheldon changed majors a dozen times in college, with a lot of focus in higher mathematics and the physical sciences. He found his passion, however, in the cultural anthropology of fashion: his graduate thesis, "Fabric of Revolution: The Plaid Patterns of the Scottish Highlands" was nearly completed in 2002. Music has consumed much of his life since then, his ukelele covers of '80s synth pop songs (recorded in his bedroom) are available for free download on Soundcloud under the name "The Uncle Sheldon Solo Project".
