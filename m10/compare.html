                Benefits I would bring and what I would change on the website...
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li> Firstly, the website does not show off their aesthetic well. They need to better Convey their unique personality and aesthetic to shoppers, bringing the in-store experience, online.</li>
                <li> Improving their aesthetics can make a significant difference. A visually appealing and well-designed website attracts more visitors, and when potential customers see an inviting website for a café, they’re a lot more likely to visit in person. </li>
                <li> Each page on the website feels disconnected, almost like they’re from entirely different websites. For instance, looking above comparing pages on the original site shows a lack of consistency. I would fix this by creating a more cohesive design, making sure every page feels like part of the same unified website.</li>
