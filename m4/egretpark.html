        <h2> Welcome to Egret Park</h2>
        <p> Our third destination is Egret Park</p>
            <p>This park is the largest out of all of them. As well as the most </p> 
            <p> populated. My brother would come here everyday after school </p>
            <p>to trade pokemon cards. They chose this park to have this </p>
            <p>occurance since it is the closest park to his school, and of   </p>
            <p>course I would have to drive him. This place is where I learned </p>
            <p>how to drive. This placeground is also known as the "Green </p>
            <p>Playground"</p>
